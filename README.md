# Advent of Code 2020
The goal is to do [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) in a different language everyday. We'll see how far I get with this. <br />
Each solution uses CLI (thought there would be multiple input files per day lol). Language used per day listed below: <br />
<br />
Day 1. Rust<br />
Day 2. Go<br />
Day 3. Ruby<br />
Day 4. Scala<br />

<h6>Note: I didn't actually complete this in 25 days :/ </h6>
